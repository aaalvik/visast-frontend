# Frontend of visAST
This project was part of my master thesis at University of Bergen, where I developed the tool visAST and examined the usefulnedd of the tool in teaching. This repository contains the frontend of the project, the backend can be found here: [...]. 

## visAST
visAST is a visualisation tool for visualising abstract syntax trees (ASTs). The tool is used to visualise expressions of a given grammar, represented as ASTs. The tool can also visualise the evaluation steps produced by a small-step evaluator.
